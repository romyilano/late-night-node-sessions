# Node.js Crash Course

Done late night at SudoRoom when I should have been resting or doing other
stuff.

Command line tutorial -> hacked the treehouse sample
to access the Open Oakland Public Service Request data off Socrata

This would be a good tutorial to get other people into node.js
and engaged. Since it's all command line it will be nice and
accessible, and then we can peruse the Oakland Open Data sets

## Examples

* Most common reasons for food recalls https://opendata.socrata.com/resource/9iuc-3wkn.json
* Overall Proficiency by ward for schools with part time or full time librarians
** https://opendata.socrata.com/Education/Overall-Proficiency-by-Ward-for-Schools-w-Full-or-/xzgu-pmpy

and so on.
